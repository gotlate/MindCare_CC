            "description": "Objectives The purpose of this study is to identify the factors affecting the mental health levels of health college students related to smartphone over-dependence and communication skills. This study attempts to provide foundational data to develop programs that aim to improve the mental health levels of health college students. \nMethods The participants of the study were 276 first and second-year health science students enrolled at a college located in J Province from September 18, 2023, to October 31, 2023. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, Scheffé tests, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. \nResults The mental health levels of health science students showed a significant positive correlation with smartphone over-dependence (r = .322, p < .001) and a significant negative correlation with communication skills (r = -.215, p < .001). hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that general characteristics, such as college life satisfaction and health status, significantly affected mental health levels. Smartphone over-dependence (β = .25, p < .001) also had a significant impact, with these variables explaining 21.9% of the variance. \nConclusions This study confirmed that smartphone over-dependence is a factor affecting the mental health levels of health college students. To improve the mental health levels of health college students, it is necessary to develop and apply educational programs that can reduce and prevent smartphone over-dependence.",

            "description": "The incidence of mental illness among college students has increased significantly in recent years. This upward trend is aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic since the worldwide pandemic is expected to negatively impacts peoples mental health. This study intents to investigate the specific effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students and some common factors that lead to those impacts. The results of previous studies show that the COVID-19 pandemic can increase the incidence of mental illness among people who have direct contact with coronavirus disease as well as people who do not have direct contact with coronavirus disease. Empirical data shows that college students likelihood of experiencing mental disorders related to depression and anxiety increased significantly while the pandemic is at its peak. College students around the world were all impacted similarly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study supports that the difficulty of adapting to the online learning system is one of the main elements that harm the psychological health of college students. Another study suggests that the lack of physical activity during the pandemic resulted in an increase in the incidence of mental disorders among college students.",

Participants: Three hundred seventy-two college students (Mage = 19.47 ± 1.74, 63.8% female; 62.8% college freshman). Methods: College students completed questionnaires for research credit in their psychology courses. Results: Screen time significantly predicted higher anxiety, depression, and stress. Spending time outdoors (“green time”) significantly predicted lower stress and depression, but not lower anxiety. Green time moderated the relationship, such that college students who spent less time outside (1SD below mean) had consistent rates of mental health symptoms across hours of screentime, but individuals who spent average/above average (mean, 1SD above mean) time outside had fewer mental health symptoms at lower levels of screentime. Conclusions: Promoting green time in students may be an effective way of improving stress and depression.",

            "description": "Student populations are susceptible to the COVID-19 pandemic and may easy develop mental health problems related to their immaturity of psychological development and fluctuation of mood. However, little has been known about the effects of the pandemic on college students and the associated influencing factors. This study aimed to explore the role of psychological resilience as a mediator between general self-efficacy and mental health. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 480 Chinese college students from 12 universities in Hunan province of China. The participants responded anonymously to the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale for College Students (RSCS), and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study. The average of GSES and RSCS scores of college students were 25.00 ± 4.68 and 137.97 ± 15.50, which were at a medium level. The average score for the GHQ-12 was 1.59 ± 1.59, and 22.03% of the college students scored ≥ 3 on the GHQ-12, indicating that they were at risk of developing mental disorders. According to the analyses of mediation effect, psychological resilience played a fully mediating role in the relationship between general self-efficacy and mental health. In conclusion, Chinese college students were at high risk of developing mental disorders during the COVID-19 period. General self-efficacy was positively associated with psychological resilience, and psychological resilience played a fully mediating role in the relationship between general self-efficacy and mental health. Future studies and interventions should aim to promote psychological resilience and general self-efficacy.",

            "title": "The correlation between lifestyle health behaviors, coping style, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among college students: Two rounds of a web-based study",
            "description": "Background During the last months of 2019, worldwide attention has focused on a pandemic of COVID-19, and the pandemic spread rapidly, becoming a public health emergency of international concern. The Chinese government has quickly taken quarantine measures and the drastic measures incurred to curtail it, which could have harmful consequences for everyone's behavior and mental health. Objective This study aimed to investigate the correlation of influencing factors and mental health symptoms among Chinese college students according to two rounds of surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This study was divided into two stages of cross-sectional investigation. In February 2020 and May 2020, two cross-sectional surveys were conducted on college students in the above areas by means of cluster sampling. From February 4 to February 12, 2020, 14,789 college students completed the first round of online study from 16 cities and universities in 21 in China, excluding participants who completed the questionnaire, and finally included 11,787 college students. After 3 months, we also conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey based on the first study area to observe the behavioral changes and psychological symptoms of college students within 3 months. Using the convenience sampling method, a survey on the cognitive and psychological status of COVID-19 among college students was conducted in 21 universities in 16 regions in May 2020. The regions among the two surveys are divided into Wuhan (District 1), neighboring Hubei (District 2), first-tier cities, namely, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (District 3), and other provinces (District 4). Results (1) In the first survey, the average age of the participants was 20.51 ± 1.88 years. One-third of the college students were male. In total, 25.9 and 17.8% of college students reported depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. College students, who reported higher ST, lower PA, higher soda beverage and tea beverage intake, have Chinese herbal medicine and vitamin drinking, and decreased frequency of diet had higher depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, infection risk, perceived resistance to COVID-19, concerns about physical symptoms, family/friends directly/indirectly contacted with confirmed cases, and seeking psychological counseling had significant associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. (2) In the second round of surveys, 6803 males (41.7%) and 9502 females (58.3%) had a mean age of 20.58 ± 1.81 years. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 was 30.7 and 23.9%, respectively. (3) In both surveys, college students who reported having higher ST, lower PA, higher soda beverage and tea beverage intake, Chinese herbal medicine and vitamin drinking, and decreased frequency of diet also had higher depression and anxiety symptoms. Coping styles with COVID-19 partially mediate the association between some related lifestyle behaviors and anxiety and depression. The results of the conditional process model analysis support our hypothesis that lifestyle behaviors, and coping styles are both predictors of anxiety and depression symptoms, with both direct and indirect effects moderated by gender level. In logistic regression analysis, the correlation of depression and anxiety in the second rounds of the survey was higher than that in the first survey. In two surveys, there was a correlation between lifestyle health behaviors and coping style, gender and mental health. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the two rounds of surveys was different, and the prevalence in the second round was higher than that in the first round, as well as that in the two rounds of surveys. All survey identified that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors were positively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. Compared with the emerged city of risk areas, other pandemic regions have a lower risk of mental health problems. The survey findings complement each other. Lifestyle health behaviors and coping style alleviated mental health symptoms. COVID-19-related social stressors were positively associated with mental health symptoms. The study also suggests that at the beginning of the pandemic, the effective management of college students' mental health problems, corresponding coping measures and maintaining a good lifestyle play a key role in the prevention and control of other cities. Understanding the college students' lifestyle behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown will help public health authorities reshape future policies on their nutritional recommendations, in preparation for future pandemics.",

A secondary purpose was to explore positive changes in health and well-being. Methods: College students completed a 45-item online survey in the fall of 2020 that examined demographics, health literacy, health behaviors, overall health and well-being, and academic and financial impacts. Median-unbiased estimation for odds ratio and exact mid-p method inference methods were conducted using R version 4.0.3. We conducted content analysis for qualitative open-ended survey responses. Results: Gender, degree program, and religiosity were associated with having mental concerns. These socio-demographic variables, along with age and ethnicity, were linked to positive and negative feelings. Participants who felt threatened, afraid, stressed, and sad were likely to report mental concerns. Participants who felt cheerful, calm, rested, and full of interests were likely to report no mental concerns. Students who felt sadder, less calm, and less full of interests were likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors. Conclusions: Findings contribute to an increased understanding of mental health and engagement of unhealthy and healthy behaviors among students informing recommendations for services across campuses and communities.",

            "description": "Background Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has generally increased levels of stress and depression among the public. However, the impact on college students in the United States has not been well-documented. Objective This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales—the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7—for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. Results Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation. Conclusions The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.",

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. Objective Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. Methods We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Results Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. Conclusions Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.",
